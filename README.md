# Damage-Prediction-of-Floods

## Abstract
Natural disasters are an increasing phenomenon clearly perceived and known to have a direct, life-altering impact on the welfare of the region it hits and its residents. Depending on where we live, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, droughts, etc are a threat to lives, properties, productive assets & financial resources. The growing incidence of natural disasters is directly proportional to the increasing vulnerability of households and communities in affected regions. In this work, an artificial neural network has been used to predict the damages caused by natural disasters that can be felt at the community, city and state level as well as on an entire country. Artificial neural networks are mathematical models, inspired by a biological neural network process â€“ the biological neuron. They are used for the modeling of various complex input and output relationships as well as to find and match patterns of any given data. This report results in the comparison of different machine learning algorithms currently used to increase the accuracy of predictions. Training various neural networks, damages occurred due to floods & earthquakes have been estimated using test data.

### Implementation
Natural disasters cause massive casualties, damages and leave many injured. Human beings cannot stop them but timely prediction and due safety measures can prevent loss of human lives and many precious objects can be saved. The main focus of this project is on the application of data-driven models in the context of real-time forecasting of the damages.

This section follows an implementation plan which includes Data Selection, Data Preprocessing and Visualization, Application of Artificial Neural Networks, and its performance evaluation.
